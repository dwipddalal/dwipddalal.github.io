Gravity,G1,Earth Fall,"Side view. A small red rubber ball is suspended in mid air about 2 meters above a flat floor. Empty white room, no extra objects.  Then apply image edit ""Little Higher""","Side view, static camera. The ball is released and It falls straight down under Earth gravity. Realistic, physics adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Gravity,G2,Moon Fall,Use same image as G1,"Side view, static camera. The ball is released and It falls straight down under Moon gravity. Realistic, physics adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Gravity,G3,Vacuum Drop,Side view of a tall and wide transparent glass vacuum chamber. A metal hammer and a feather are side by side of each other at the very top of the chamber with ample space between them. Both the hammer and the feather are completely inside the chamber. The chamber is placed on the floor and the whole chamber is visible form top to bottom.,"Side view of a tall vacuum chamber. A metal hammer and a feather are released simultaneously from the top and they fall, hitting the bottom. Realistic, physics adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Gravity,G4,Projectile Arc,"NA - had to use Image edit, no model could generate this properly","A ball shoots out from the launcher on the left which follows trajectory under gravity and falls to the ground. Realistic, physics adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Buoyancy,B1,Heavy Sink,"Side view of a clear glass water tank. A small heavy solid steel ball suspended in air 15 cm above the surface of the water. Tripod shot, fixed camera."," A heavy solid steel ball is dropped into the water. Realistic, physics adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Buoyancy,B2,Light Float,"B1 Image Edit ""Make the metal ball a white hollow plastic ball ""","A hollow plastic ball is dropped into the water. Realistic, physics‑adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Buoyancy,B3,Pop-up,"Side view of a clear glass water tank. A small rectangular wooden block (light pine, ~5×5×5 cm) is fully submerged and at the bottom of the water tank. Tripod shot, fixed camera.","The light wooden block at the bottom of the surface is released. Realistic, physics‑adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Collisions,C1,Elastic Head On,"Top‑down orthogonal view of a green billiards table (no pockets in frame), even cloth texture. Two polished billiard balls (red ball on the left and blue ball on the right are aligned on the horizontal midline: separated by about 30 cm. Soft overhead lighting. No cues, no hands, no chalk marks. Camera perfectly perpendicular to the table to avoid perspective skew.","The blue billiard ball is struck by a cue stick from the right and the blue ball moves toward a stationary red ball. They collide head-on. Realistic, physics‑adhering video, Static top-down fixed camera, no camera motion."
Collisions,C2,Glancing Blow,"C1 Image edit ""Move the ball very slightly upwards so that they red and blue balls are offset by a little less than the radius of the ball. ""","Top-down, fixed camera on a billiard table. Cue stick enters from the right, hits a blue ball.
Blue ball rolls left, strikes a stationary red ball off-center in an oblique collision. Realistic, physics‑adhering video, Static top-down fixed camera, no camera motion."
Collisions,C3,Tower Topple,"Side view of a vertical tower of wooden blocks (Jenga‑style) stacked neatly on a smooth tabletop, centered in frame. A single identical wooden block sits on the left on the tabletop aligned with the tower’s bottom layer, with a ~10 cm gap between it and the tower. Plain neutral backdrop, soft studio lighting, no people or tools visible.","Side view of a vertical stack of wooden blocks. The block on the left slides in and hits the base at very high speed. Realistic, physics‑adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
Collisions,C4,Springs,"Side-view physics lab setup. A small metal cart with a wooden block on top rests on straight, horizontal rails in front of a long horizontal spring that is fixed to a rigid wall. The spring is uncompressed. Simple, realistic style, neutral background, no motion blur, clear view of cart, block, rails, spring, and wall. The block is on the left and the spring is on the right. There is a very big gap between the end of the spring and the cart.  The spring is level with the cart. -> Then image edit ""Make the diameter of the spring a bit bigger and make it rest on the ground so it does not droop."" ","Static side view. The metal cart slides smoothly to the right along the rails. It makes contact with the large metal spring. The spring compresses horizontally against the wall as the cart pushes into it. Realistic, physics‑adhering video, tripod shot, fixed camera, no camera motion."
